Client: 
		=> Background video in the homepage
		=> Webapp should contain 5 web pages(HOME, ABOUT US, CONTACT US, GALLERY, STUDENT PORTAL)
		=> Client already told us about the UI part.

Software company:
	   => Code all these 3 things(required by Client)
	   => Sent the code to the client.(ALPHA VERSION)
	   => Client will review it.
	   => Suppose there requirements changed:
	     - Webapp should contain 3 web pages(HOME, GALLERY, CONTACT US)
	     - Changes in UI.
	   => Sent the code to the client again.(BETA VERSION)
	   => Client will review it again. 
	   => Client told you to make some more changes.
	   => You will make changes and send updated code to the client & client accepted it.
	   => So the version of code which client has accepted is called FINAL VERSION.
