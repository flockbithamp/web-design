# Parsing XML:

## WE LEARNED SO FAR .....
- What is XML?
- What is XLS?
- How to use XML & XLS together?
- Why we use XLS?

## What we will cover?
- Parsing XML data using jQuery.
- Parsing XML data using PHP. (We will coer this part when we will start PHP).

## What is jQuery?
- It is a javascript(js) library. 
- It has a potential to perform all the logical tasks which pure js performs.
- With jQuery the code will be smaller and more descriptive.
- Eg: If I have to get name from an input tag:
   -- var name = document.getElementById('name').value; (JS code)
   -- var name = $('name').val(); (jQuery code)

### Exercise 1: Parse XML given inside js code.
### Exercise 2: Parse XML from XML file. (Giving CORS error)
